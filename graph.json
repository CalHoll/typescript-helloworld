This file simply logs the message 'Hello World' to the console.\n\nWhile this specific file does not contain any complex functionality, it serves as a starting point for a larger application. The purpose of this file is to demonstrate the basic setup and structure of a TypeScript project, where the 'index.ts' file is typically used to bootstrap the application and import or call other modules or components as needed.\n\nIn a more complex application, the 'index.ts' file would likely import and initialize the main application components, such as the routing, state management, and user interface components. It would also likely set up any necessary global configurations or middleware that the application requires.\n\nFor example, in a web application built with a framework like React, the 'index.ts' file would typically import the main React component and render it to the DOM. It might also set up global state management, handle routing, or configure any other necessary services or utilities.\n\nIn a server-side application built with a framework like Node.js, the 'index.ts' file would likely import the main server module, set up any necessary middleware (such as for handling HTTP requests, parsing request bodies, or logging), and start the server.\n\nSo while this specific 'index.ts' file is very simple, in a real-world application, it would serve as the central hub that ties together all the different components and functionality of the application. It is the entry point that bootstraps the entire application and ensures that all the necessary pieces are set up and ready to go.\n"
