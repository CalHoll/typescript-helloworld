The purpose of this script is to serve as a basic entry point or starting point for a larger application or codebase.\n\nThe script consists of six consecutive console.log() statements that print the following messages to the console:\n\n1. 'Hello World!'\n2. '...'\n3. 'Goodbye World!'\n4. '...'\n5. 'Hello again!'\n6. '...'\n7. 'TEST!'\n\nEach message is printed on a new line, with the '...' messages acting as separators between the different message groups.\n\nThis script does not interact with or depend on any other files or components. It is a self-contained script that simply outputs a series of pre-defined messages to the console. There are no classes, functions, or other significant logic implemented in this script - it is purely for demonstration or testing purposes.\n\nFrom an algorithmic perspective, this script is extremely simple. It follows a linear flow, executing each console.log() statement in order, without any branching, looping, or other control flow mechanisms. The sole purpose of the script is to output the specified messages to the console.\n\nIn summary, this 'src/index.ts' file is a basic entry point that serves as a starting point for a larger application or codebase. It demonstrates the use of console.log() to print messages to the console, but does not contain any significant functionality or logic beyond that. It is a simple, self-contained script that could be used for testing, demonstration, or as a foundation for building a more complex application.\n"
