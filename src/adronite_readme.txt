src/index.ts
***
The file 'src/index.ts' is a simple TypeScript script that prints a series of messages to the console. The purpose of this script is to serve as a basic entry point or starting point for a larger application or codebase.

The script consists of six consecutive console.log() statements that print the following messages to the console:

1. 'Hello World!'
2. '...'
3. 'Goodbye World!'
4. '...'
5. 'Hello again!'
6. '...'
7. 'TEST!'

Each message is printed on a new line, with the '...' messages acting as separators between the different message groups.

This script does not interact with or depend on any other files or components. It is a self-contained script that simply outputs a series of pre-defined messages to the console. There are no classes, functions, or other significant logic implemented in this script - it is purely for demonstration or testing purposes.

From an algorithmic perspective, this script is extremely simple. It follows a linear flow, executing each console.log() statement in order, without any branching, looping, or other control flow mechanisms. The sole purpose of the script is to output the specified messages to the console.

In summary, this 'src/index.ts' file is a basic entry point that serves as a starting point for a larger application or codebase. It demonstrates the use of console.log() to print messages to the console, but does not contain any significant functionality or logic beyond that. It is a simple, self-contained script that could be used for testing, demonstration, or as a foundation for building a more complex application.
